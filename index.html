            <h2>Letter of Introduction</h2>
            <p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
            <p></p>
             <p>My name is Ruiyang Ma. Iâ€™m an undergrad student looking for an opportunity to join your team. 
                 In 2017, I graduated from a high school in China and received a high school diploma. 
                 I will complete my Bachelor of Information Science at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock by May 2022. 
                 After entering the university, I developed good study habits. 
                 The courses I have learned cover many aspects from basic computer knowledge to application. 
                 Through the study of this knowledge, I have a certain degree of understanding and mastery of relevant knowledge in this field. 
                 And I did a lot of practice to further deepen my understanding of computers. 
                 While learning the basic knowledge well, I also pay attention to various aspects of development. 
                 I have participated in various school activities many times and combined theory and practice during the internship.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>During my university studies, I absorbed a wealth of professional knowledge and exercised my abilities. 
                I have mastered Python language, Java language, principles of compilation, principles of database... and have a certain understanding of JS, HTML, CSS, windows programming, etc. 
                After class, I also taught myself Delphi programming, asp dynamic web pages, and flash animation.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I look forward to discussing my qualifications for this job and answering any questions you have about me. I have attached my resume for your review. 
                My contact information has been listed below. Thank you for your consideration.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
